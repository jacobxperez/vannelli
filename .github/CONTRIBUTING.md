## Bug Reports

Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What is your environment?
What steps will reproduce the issue? What browser(s) and OS experience the problem?
What would you expect to be the outcome? All these details will help us fix any
potential bugs.

## Feature Requests

Before opening a feature request, please take a moment to find out whether your idea
fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to convince the project's
developers of the merits of this feature. Please provide as much detail and context
as possible.

## Pull Requests

Ask first before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g. implementing features,
refactoring code, porting to a different language), otherwise you risk spending a lot of
time working on something that the project's developers might not want to merge into the
project. When contributing code to this project ask yourself these questions.

* Is it essential?
* Will it add value?
* Is this change necessary?

## Acknowledgment

I want to dedicate this project to all developers, architects, and designers who
have fiddled with the limitations of CSS. I know your pain, your struggles, and
your frustrations. May we all find peace and tranquility in our hearts and mind.
